Looking at these lines of GDB trace, we can conclude that the BIOS does the following few things:
1. Set up stack pointers
2. Disable interrupts and sets memory copying direction
3. Enters protected mode
4. Set up data segment registers

## Exercise 3
1. The processor starts executing in 32-bit mode after executing `ljmp    $PROT_MODE_CSEG, $protcseg`. This line of code causes the instruction pointer and code segment register to jump to a new location, and clear the pipeline.
2. The last instruction executed by the boot loader: `call   *0x10018`; the first instruction executed by the kernel: `add    0x1bad(%eax),%dh`.
3. The first instruction of the kernel is located at physical memory address `0xf0100000`, which is given by `ELFHDR->e_entry` and the loader.
4. The boot loader uses `ELFHDR->e_phnum`, which is given in the kernel image ELF file, to determine how many sections to load.

## Exercise 4
`memory.c` is as follows:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void
f(void)
{
    int a[4];
    int *b = malloc(16);
    int *c;
    int i;

    printf("1: a = %p, b = %p, c = %p\n", a, b, c);

    c = a;
    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
	a[i] = 100 + i;
    c[0] = 200;
    printf("2: a[0] = %d, a[1] = %d, a[2] = %d, a[3] = %d\n",
	   a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);

    c[1] = 300;
    *(c + 2) = 301;
    3[c] = 302;
    printf("3: a[0] = %d, a[1] = %d, a[2] = %d, a[3] = %d\n",
	   a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);

    c = c + 1;
    *c = 400;
    printf("4: a[0] = %d, a[1] = %d, a[2] = %d, a[3] = %d\n",
	   a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);

    c = (int *) ((char *) c + 1);
    *c = 500;
    printf("5: a[0] = %d, a[1] = %d, a[2] = %d, a[3] = %d\n",
	   a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]);

    b = (int *) a + 1;
    c = (int *) ((char *) a + 1);
    printf("6: a = %p, b = %p, c = %p\n", a, b, c);
}

int
main(int ac, char **av)
{
    f();
    return 0;
}
```

In the first 3 blocks, `a, b, c` are all aligned to the beginning of integers, thus integers are printed out. However, in the 4th block, `c` is no longer aligned, yet wrote to 4 bytes of memory, causing two integers to be corrupted.

## Exercise 5
If we change the linking address to `0x7b00`, then something would break at `ljmp   $0x8,$0x7b32`, or `ljmp    $PROT_MODE_CSEG, $protcseg`. This is because the location of `protcseg` is determined at link-time and is changed as we changes the linking address, but the BIOS is hard-wired to jump to `0x7c00`. 

## Exercise 6
At the point the BIOS enters the boot loader, the 8 words of memory at `0x00100000` are all empty; while when the boot loader enters the kernel, they are all occupied. In `./kern/kernel.ld`, there's a block of code that reads:
```
.text : AT(0x100000) {
		*(.text .stub .text.* .gnu.linkonce.t.*)
}
```
Which means that the `.text` section of the kernal are loaded at `0x00100000`. That's what's present at the memory address.

## Exercise 7
Right after the instruction, memory right above `0x00100000` was mirrored to `0xf0100000`, which was previously empty. This is because by altering the `%cr0` register, we have enabled virtual memory.
The first line of code to fail would be `jmp	*%eax`, where `%eax` holds `0xf010002f`. Without virtual memory enabled, jumping to this address would be illegal.

## Exercise 8
**Code Fragment:**
```c
// (unsigned) octal
case 'o':
    num = getuint(&ap, lflag);
    base = 8;
    goto number;
```

1. `console.c` exports `cputchar()`, which is used by `putch()`; besides, `putch()` is passed as an argument to `vprintfmt`.
2. When the current output position is outside the screen, the contents of the screen is moved up until `crt_pos` is inside the screen.
3. Answer the following questions:
   1. `fmt` points to the format string `"x %d, y %x, z %d\n"` at `%ebp + 8`; `ap` points to the va_list at `%ebp + 12`
   2. 
   ```c
   vcprintf("x %d, y %x, z %d\n", va_list{x, y, z})
   cons_putc('x')
   cons_putc(' ')
   va_arg()		ap: {x, y, z} -> {y, z}
   cons_putc('1')
   cons_putc(',')
   cons_putc(' ')
   cons_putc('y')
   cons_putc(' ')
   va_arg()		ap: {y, z} -> {z}
   cons_putc('3')
   cons_putc(',')
   cons_putc(' ')
   cons_putc('z')
   cons_putc(' ')
   va_arg()		ap: {z} -> {}
   cons_putc('4')
   cons_putc('4')
   cons_putc('\n')
   ```
4. The output is `He110 World`. This is because 57616 equals `0xe110`; and when `i` is stored in memory, its bytes are arranges from least to most significant, that is `72 6c 64`, which translates to rld in ASCII. In a big-endian system, we can change `i` to `0x726c6400`.
5. The value will be the value at `%ebp + 12`. This is because the va_list is too short, so when printing the second `%d`, the va_list, which was stored at `%ebp + 12`, is consumed and content at `%ebp + 12` is printed.
6. Simply change to `cprintf(..., const char* fmt)`, at the same time flipping the order of the variable arguments.

## Exercise 9
In `./kern/entry.S` we see:
```
bootstack:
	.space		KSTKSIZE
	.globl		bootstacktop   
```
Thus the stack was allocated a size of `KSTKSIZE`, with the stck pointer pointing to `bootstacktop`, which is also the top of the stack.

## Exercise 10
At each call, `test_backtrace` pushed `x-1`, the return address and `%ebp` to the stack, for a total of 3 words.

## Exercise 11
According to the way GCC passes arguments by the stack, we can write:
```c
int
mon_backtrace(int argc, char **argv, struct Trapframe *tf)
{
	uint32_t ebp = read_ebp();

    cprintf("Stack backtrace:\n");

    while (ebp) {
        cprintf("  ebp %08x  eip %08x  args %08x %08x %08x %08x %08x\n", 
                ebp,
				*(uint32_t *)(ebp + 4),
				*(uint32_t *)(ebp + 8),
				*(uint32_t *)(ebp + 12),
                *(uint32_t *)(ebp + 16),
				*(uint32_t *)(ebp + 20),
				*(uint32_t *)(ebp + 24));
        ebp = *(uint32_t *)ebp;
    }   
    return 0;
}
```

## Exercise 12
In `debuginfo_eip`, add the following:
```c
stab_binsearch(stabs, &lline, &rline, N_SLINE, addr);
	if (lline <= rline)
		info->eip_line = stabs[lline].n_desc;
	else // Line not found, exit with negative value
		return -1;
```
Which finds the line number in the source code according to its address.

Then in `mon_backtrace`:
```c
int
mon_backtrace(int argc, char **argv, struct Trapframe *tf)
{
	struct Eipdebuginfo info;

	uint32_t ebp = read_ebp();

    cprintf("Stack backtrace:\n");

    while (ebp) {
		if (debuginfo_eip(*(uint32_t *)(ebp + 4), &info) < 0)
			panic("Address not found in mon_backtrace");
        cprintf("  ebp %08x  eip %08x  args %08x %08x %08x %08x %08x\n         %s:%d: %.*s+%d\n", 
                ebp,
				*(uint32_t *)(ebp + 4),
				*(uint32_t *)(ebp + 8),
				*(uint32_t *)(ebp + 12),
                *(uint32_t *)(ebp + 16),
				*(uint32_t *)(ebp + 20),
				*(uint32_t *)(ebp + 24),
				info.eip_file,
				info.eip_line,
				info.eip_fn_namelen,
				info.eip_fn_name,
				*(uint32_t *)(ebp + 4) - info.eip_fn_addr);
        ebp = *(uint32_t *)ebp;
    }   
    return 0;
}
```

Finally, add `{"backtrace", "Backtrace the call of functions", mon_backtrace}` to `commands` to make `backtrace` callable.
